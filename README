We've all done something like this:

$('#id').text('new text');

And wondered why the code wasn't working only to find out the selector was wrong. jQuery.whiny.js attempts
to solve this problem by altering the jQuery library so the jQuery() method will create a console warning
if an empty jQuery object is returned.

In the above example, if '#id' returned an empty jQuery object you'd see the following console warning:

"jQuery was called with a selector of '#id' and returned an empty object"


Note: This is strictly for dev purposes!


Additionally, the name of this script was inspired by "whiny nil" from Ruby on Rails.
